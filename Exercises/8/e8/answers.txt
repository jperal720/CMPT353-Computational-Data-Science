2. Yes, I think the mistakes are very reasonable. For example, my model seems to make the wrong predictions between Anchorage, Edmonton and Alberta, the last two cities are located in the same province (naturally they will have very similar climate data), when analyzing the climographs between the last two and Anchorage, you can clearly see the similarities in temperatures and, not to the same extent, precipitations. And one weather feature that we could, perhaps, include to further improve the data would be humidity.}
